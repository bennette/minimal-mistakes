###Abstract
Data preprocessing to improve the quality of data utilized by classification algorithms is an important step in knowledge discovery that can be performed in part by instance selection algorithms.  In this paper, concepts from column generation and the set covering problem are used to construct high quality subsets of training instances to be used as decision variables in such instance selection procedures.  A greedy and Nested Partitions selection procedure are used with the constructed decision variables and show that improvements of classifier accuracy are possible for a variety of datasets using decision tree, na√Øve Bayes, and logistic regression classifiers.
